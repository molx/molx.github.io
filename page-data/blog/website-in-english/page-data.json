On the other hand, I have faith that most people that will stumble upon this website will be able to get the grasp of the information here even if it's in English. Not to say it looks international and cool! ðŸ˜Ž</p>\n<p>So, the website is now in English. Thankfully there was not a lot of content to translate... And of course, it's not worth the trouble to have it in both languages, especially considering I'd suffer having to remember the ways around Gatsby again.</p>\n<p>I don't post here very often, so this will probably be the top post for a long time. See you in a few years!</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":"website-in-english","title":"This website is now in English!","date":"2023-09-04","author":"Alan MÃ³l"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/website-in-english","postPath":"/blog/website-in-english"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1500388132"],"slicesMap":{}}
